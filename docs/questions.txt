- Are self-edges allowed in the graph?
  - I guess we can discard them because you can never have a repeated vertex in
    a maximal path anyway?

- Are duplicate edges allowed?

- Any limits on the size of the graph?
  - Clearly the number of nodes is limited to (26 ** 3).
  - What about the number of edges?
  - Worst case is every node connected to every other node
    = (26 ** 3) * (26 **3) = (26 ** 6) edges
  - Each edge can be represented as a single bit in an adjacency matrix
    = (26 ** 6) / 8 bytes = approx 37 Mb.
  - However, number of paths increases exponentially according to the average
    number of connections per node, which will get really big really quickly if
    each node has lots of connections.
