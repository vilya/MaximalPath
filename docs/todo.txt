- Run the printing in parallel with the counting.
- Replace recursion with iteration, see if it speeds things up.

- Optimise the file parsing:
  - mmap the graph file
  - quick error check: test whether the length is a multiple of 7 (each line
    should be 3 chars for the from node, 3 chars for the to node and a
    newline).
  - multithreaded processing of the mmapped region? -> only if it's big enough!
  - it's unlikely to be big enough for this problem.

- Optimise the output:
  - preallocate a nice large temp buffer.
  - write into the buffer
  - flush to stdout only when the buffer gets full.

  - allocate a line buffer of size 3 * N + 1 (where N is the number of nodes)
  - fill that incrementally as we walk the tree
  - when we find a maximal path, flush it.
